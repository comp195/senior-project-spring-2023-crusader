Project description:
2D Unity Game with a knights theme. Single player game that is executable from a .exe file. Player must survive the levels leading up to the main boss scene by avoiding taking damage from small enemies. Player will be able to eliminate enemies with attacks and new attacks will be unlocked as game progresses. If player loses at any point in the game they will have the option to restart. Once the player defeats the main boss they have completed the game.


Project Components:
Our team has successfully accessed our unity game and are able to push and pull without conflicts. We have made our first map scene using 2d box colliders that we will need for our gameplay. We have the assets we will use throughout the project uploaded into our unity folders for easy access.
